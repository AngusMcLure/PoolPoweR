\usage{
fixed_design(
  pool_size = NULL,
  pool_number = NULL,
  cluster_number,
  sensitivity = 1,
  specificity = 1,
  total_units = NULL
)

variable_design(catch_dist, pool_strat, sensitivity = 1, specificity = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{pool_size}{numeric/NULL The number of units per pool. Must be a numeric
value greater than 0. `fixed_design` only.}

\item{pool_number}{numeric/NULL The number of pools per cluster. Numeric
inputs must be an integer greater than or equal to 1. `fixed_design` only.}

\item{cluster_number}{numeric The total number of clusters in a cluster
survey design. Set to 1 for unclustered analyses, i.e. where all collection
happens at a single site or collected via simple random sampling from the
target population.}

\item{sensitivity}{numeric The probability that the test correctly identifies
a true positive. Must be a numeric value between 0 and 1, inclusive of
both. A value of 1 indicates that the test can perfectly identify all true
positives.}

\item{specificity}{numeric The probability that the test correctly identifies
a true negative. Must be a numeric value between 0 and 1, inclusive of
both. A value of 1 indicates that the test can perfectly identify all true
negatives.}

\item{total_units}{numeric/NULL internal use only for cases when this needs
to be Inf.}

\item{catch_dist}{An object of class `distribution` (e.g. produced by
`nb_catch()`) defining the distribution of the possible catch. If
`correlation = 0` the catch is for the whole survey. For `correlation > 0`
the catch is per cluster (i.e. cluster size). `variable_design` only.}

\item{pool_strat}{function Defines a rule for how a number of units will be
divided into pools. Must take a single numeric argument and return a named
list of pool sizes and pool numbers. `pool_max_size()` and
`pool_target_number` provide convenience functions for defining common
pooling strategies. `variable_design` only.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{sample_design}
}
\description{
Stores parameters related to the sampling design. Aims to reduce having to
input each param separately across functions (e.g. power/optimise). Can
either be of class `fixed_design` or `variable_design`.
