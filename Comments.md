## Methods

The authors have addressed most of my concerns here.

## Results

The authors have addressed most of my concerns here.

Line 342: Language 'essential role' implies a causal link. A non-causal alternative might be 'strong association'.

## Conclusions

The authors have addressed my minor concerns here, but not my major concerns about causal inference.

Lines 369â€“373: The authors are drawing (tentative) causal conclusions. However because the never treatment is measuring events *before* the associated risk factor (current fear of side effects), their analysis <u>does not</u> support this conclusion. Given their analysis, it would be as sensible (if not *more* sensible) to conclude that never taking the drugs makes people afraid of side effects (or equivalently that taking the drugs make people less afraid of side effects).

Lines 382-388: As with lines 369-373, the authors are drawing a *strong* causal link from *current* knowledge of how to take the drugs to *past* treatment, i.e. reverse causality is a very real danger here. It would be more sensible to conclude that past experience of taking the drugs makes people more aware of how to take the drugs. 

Lines 400-404: Again they are making a causal inference here. This is less problematic than the other instances since the causality is essentially the same even if it is reversed: (A) respondents family's participation might have made participants more likely to take the drugs, or (B) the participants taking the drugs made it more likely for their families to take the drugs. Other types of association are a greater concern here, namely common cause (e.g. household not offered treatment). 

Lines 439-445: This summary implies the study has found causals link from knowledge and self-efficacy to being treatment that are not supported by the analysis. The recommendation to reassure people about side effects only makes sense if fear of side effects is causing people to reject treatment. If the casual link is actually mostly the other way round (past treatment reassures people), educating people will not have the desired effect.

## Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications

The p-values in Table 1 are for variables rather than particular levels and therefore should probably line up with the variable name rather than names of the level: e.g. 'Age' rather than '<20 years old'.

Line 367: Change 'they' to 'side effects'. Both times I've read this sentence I thought 'they' was referring to 'individual perception, namely fear' until I got to the end of the sentence and realised the authors meant 'side effects'! :)

## Summary and General Comments

The authors have addressed all the minor concerns very thoroughly, but I am afraid they have not addressed my major concern with the conclusions of the paper. This may have been because I did not sufficiently highlight the areas of concern in my previous review. My long-winded suggestions about possible alternative analyses may have distracted from my underlying concerns.

In this re-review I have indicated the specific lines where the authors are, I believe, implying, assuming, or making statements about causality that are not supported by their analysis. Some of their strong causal conclusions in the discussion section and the their overall conclusions in the 'Conclusions' section have a high risk of 'reverse causality'. As the authors have indicated that further analysis is outside the scope of the paper, they need to either remove the statements of causality or also include other reasonable explanations of the association (i.e. factor X might cause treatment, treatment might cause factor X, or treatment and factor X might have a common cause). It would also be appropriate to include a sentence in the limitations section outlining why the study design makes difficult/impossible to draw causal links from non-static risk factors (such as knowledge, age etc.) to never-treatment. However, I should be clear that given the high risk of reverse causality I think a statement in the limitations section would not, by itself, be sufficient to address my concerns.

I would like to thank the authors for taking time to respond to all my comments.
